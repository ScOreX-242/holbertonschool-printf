.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.sp
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf()
function writes output to stdout, the standard output stream, under the control of a
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.
.PP
The format string is a character string composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not
.B %
), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
.PP
Each conversion specification is introduced by the character
.B %
and ends with a
.B conversion specifier
.
.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
The character after the 
.B % 
determines the type of conversion to be applied. The following specifiers are supported:
.TP
.B c
The
.I int
argument is converted to an
.I unsigned char
and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
The
.I char *
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of characters (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0'). If the pointer is 
.B NULL
, the string 
.B (null)
is printed.
.TP
.B %
A 
.B %
is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is 
.B %%
.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion,
.B _printf()
returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SH EXAMPLES
To print a character:
.IP
_printf("Character:[%c]\\n", 'H');
.PP
To print a string:
.IP
_printf("String:[%s]\\n", "I am a string !");
.PP
To print a literal percent sign:
.IP
_printf("Percent:[%%]\\n");
